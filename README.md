# Eva Automata robot-test
Using the EVA SDK Automata and a 2D grid class for creating a simple Pick and Drop scenario between two 2D grids. Calculation of the joints is performed for each iteration during the execution (might be a bit slower). 
The digital gripper Schunk EGP 40 for pick and place is utilised and tested in this example. 
The  code uses the 2DGrid class from the EVA Automata examples - this is without any changes. Check another repository for 3D scenario with customised class.
